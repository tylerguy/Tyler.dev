      <p>
        Welcome to my Website, it's a bit empty at the moment but it will soon
        be updated with more content including any projects I'm working on, my
        blog and more. For now, here's a list of some of the things I'm working
        on: - Studio game based around vehicle combat. - A 2d Arcade game - 3D
        model of a suit of armor, animation and rigging. This is everything
        academically, I'm also working on a few personal projects, including: -
        This website you see here - Several discord bots (using discord.js) -
        Experimenting with full stack web development (using react, node,
        express, mongoDB) - A few other things I can't remember right now.
        That's all for now, I'll update this page with more information soon.
        Thanks for visiting!
