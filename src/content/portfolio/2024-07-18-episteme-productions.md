Episteme Productions was an animation studio that also hired me to work on their ongoing ARG, [Project Grindstone](https://tylerdev.space./media/2024-07-04-project-grindstone), I worked alongside a concept artist to design their website that would become their location to showcase their work to outside investors once they were ready to go public. Using a concept made by their concept artist and existing work I had already done with them, I went about making a website that looked professional but also took some inspiration from the website of Project Grindstone which was ultimately their primary work. Alongside web design responsibilties, I also had a hand in streamlining internal communication and organisation, setting up a workspace that would allow everyone to stay in the loop in what other team members were working on.

Tools/Technologies Used:

* Wordpress, used for designing the website.

* [Mailcow](https://mailcow.email/), used for setting up emails for the ARG aspect and setting up a workspace for storing files and keeping track of events.
