Infinite Care was a care provider that worked alongside me to modernise and streamline their website. Throughout my time working with them, I helped making their website more accessible and improved their backend processes to make sure that proper reporting was in place for site outages and made sure that security of the site was strong. During the development process, I made sure to get constant feedback and make changes where necessary, while also justifying anything that I feel should stay the same. Alongside the website, I also assisted in setting up new social pages and getting emails setup for everyone on the team.
