Infinite Care was a care provider that worked alongside me to modernise and streamline their website. Throughout my time working with them, I helped making their website more accessible and improved their backend processes to make sure that proper reporting was in place for site outages and made sure that security of the site was strong. During the development process, I made sure to get constant feedback and make changes where necessary, while also justifying anything that I feel should stay the same. Alongside the website, I also assisted in setting up new social pages and as well as optimising branding for display on these platforms.

Technologies/tools used:

* Wordpress, using the theme editor to adjust an existing theme to fit the needs of the project, using CSS where needed to style individual elements.

* Photoshop, used to scale existing images and remaster branding for use in the website and socials
