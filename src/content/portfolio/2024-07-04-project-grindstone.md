Project Grindstone was an ARG (Alternate Reality Game) with heavy fantasy/supernatural themes. Throughout my time on the project, I was responsible for maintaining and adding content to the website for use in user engagement and promotion of the project to a wider audience. During my time on the team, I transformed the functionality of the website to include more automation and improved user experience. Alongside my web design responsibilities, I also had a hand in setting up ads and tracking their impact on growth of the userbase as well as sending out regular emails to inform users of any new content to engage with.

Technologies/Tools Used:

*   Wordpress, used mainly for website hosting and content management. CSS was used a lot here to adapt the theme chosen to fit the concept for the final website.
    
*   Express.js, primarily used for serving one-off pages that require some form of automation
    
*   C++, used for [a one off terminal emulator](https://github.com/tylerguy/G-) that concluded a story arc
    
*   [n8n.io,](https://n8n.io/) for automation between different api's and services, in this case mainly used for db updates and email automation.
    
*   Discord.js, mainly used for users to fetch progress on tasks completed on the website as well as provide a way to sign into the website using discord.
